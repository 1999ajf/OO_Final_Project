# OO_Final_Project

My final project for Object Oriented Design.

It is a meal planner/shceduler that allows the user to create and veiw a weekly meal schedule and the associated grocery list. 
The user can also add new recipes to be used in the schedule.
In future versions, I may add some delete functionality, so that users can remove old schedules or delete recipes they no longer need.
I may also implement some form of SQL for a database in the future, as I am currently just using lists to store things.
